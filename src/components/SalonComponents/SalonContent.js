           We are a spa-like salon based in a beautiful barn conversion on Clifton Fields, just
            outside of Freckleton. The salon is home to eight talented freelance artists, who create a friendly and relaxed
            environment whilst giving you your dream hair.

              What started as solely a hairdressing salon soon evolved to include
              nail, lash and brow treatments. No matter the treatment you choose, you can be confident that Utopia
              Hair Co will provide you with the best results and the ultimate
              luxury experience.
